# Developer Preferences Analysis - StackOverflow Survey 2024

## Overview

This project explores the 2024 StackOverflow Developer Survey data to understand trends and make predictions about developers' work preferences. We predict whether a developer prefers remote work based on various factors such as experience, age, salary, and company size.

## Data Source

The dataset comes from the [StackOverflow Developer Survey 2024](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/), a comprehensive survey of developers worldwide. The dataset includes information on programming languages, developer experience, job satisfaction, and more.

## Key Findings

- A large percentage of developers prefer remote work.
- More experienced developers tend to have higher salaries.
- Developers from larger companies generally report more satisfaction and prefer hybrid or remote working options.
